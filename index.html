   <h2> ABOUT </h2>
   <p>
   Hello! My name is Nathan and all of the countries highlighted <span style="color: green"> GREEN </span> on the map are places that I have been to before. Traveling to these 
   different countries are some of my favorite things I have ever gotten to do. Traveling to so many different places, you are able to see how different cultures have developed
   over the centuries and it is truly amazing to see the differences. I would highly encourage you to make an effort to see the world.<br><br>
	Have a look around the website and see if there is anything interesting that could help you plan your next excursion!
