<p> On my trip across Europe in 2019, I stopped in Morocco. Though I have only been to one country in Africa so far, I can whole-heartedly say that it was one of
my favorite countries I have ever been to. I hope to explore the rest of Africa sometime in the future.

  <h4> FUN FACT </h4>
   <ul> <li> French is spoken by most citizens in Morocco. This is because they declared their independence from France fairly recently in 1956 </li> </ul>
